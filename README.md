# Trigger-Tracker
Group Project - An app that takes in environment statistics like Air Pollution level, Pollen Count, Air Pressure and notifies the users of the median levels in their current location. This can in effect track if there is any anomaly and specify any triggers such as Asthma, Allergy and/or Migraine that the user might be prone to in their current location or any place they plan to travel to.  The app can also have a general overall statistics of the current location when the user is not signed in.
